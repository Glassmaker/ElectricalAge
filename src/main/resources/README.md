## ABOUT
[ELN](http://electrical-age.net/) is a Minecraft Mod offering the ability to perform large-scale in-game electrical simulations. Here is some highlighted features:

A better simulation
> Electrical simulation with resistive and capacitive effects. Behaviour similar to those of real life objects.
	
Multiple electrical sources
> Furnaces, Solar panels, Wind turbines, Batteries, Capacitors, ...
	
Break the cube
> Cables, sensors, actuators, alarms, etc. can be placed on each face (outer and inner) of a cube, which allows a significant reduction of the consumed space by electrical installations.
	
Night-lighting revisited
> Lamps, switches, captors, ...
	
Small and big electricals consumers
> From the lamps, electrical furnaces... to the miners, transporters...

Incredible tools
> XRay scanner, flashlight, portable mining drill...

Genericity
> Old redstones circuits can be exploited with electrical<->redstones converters.
	
Game lifetime/complexity extended
> A consequent list of new raw materials and items...
